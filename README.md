This is a Homepage assignment for CS50 Harvarg programm. I was assigned to do a few pages with CSS and JS and some Bootstrap features. I took it like an apportunity to make something helpful for me, part of the selfcare.
The main idea was to make private reminders but without using databases. 

So I decided to use [Local Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to store data like dates when I done something and movie/book titles I like recently. So when I come back to the site (from the same device and browser, of course), I am able to see my previous enterings and date checks.
